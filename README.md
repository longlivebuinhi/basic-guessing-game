# basic-guessing-game
### My first practical exercise at college
This program includes 3 basic guessing games: 
- Guess the coin 
- Guess the dice
- Guess the number

You will have to insert your wallet and how much money you want to bet in a round before the game starts. 

The rule is very simple: x2 your money or **lose it all**. But don't worry. After a round, you can decide either you want to keep going or not.

So, shall we begin?
